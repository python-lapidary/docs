# Lapidary - Python OpenAPI client

[![test](https://github.com/python-lapidary/lapidary/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/python-lapidary/lapidary/actions/workflows/test.yaml)

Lapidary is a client library for remote APIs described with the OpenAPI specification,
and a program to generate models and clients stubs for those APIs.

Together, the generated client and the library, let developers use remote APIs as if they were local libraries.


This repository holds sources for the client library. Currently, it requires model classes generated by [Lapidary render](https://github.com/python-lapidary/lapidary-render) to function.

## Examples

Check the [library of client projects](https://github.com/orgs/lapidary-library/repositories).
